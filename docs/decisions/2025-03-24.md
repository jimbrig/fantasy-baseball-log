Your decision to drop **Austin Wells** for **Victor Scott II** and **Drew Rasmussen** for **AJ Smith-Shawver** is bold but strategically sound given your league's setup and needs. Here's an analysis of the risks and potential rewards of this approach:

---

## **Move 1: Dropping Austin Wells for Victor Scott II**

### **Rationale**

1. **Steals Category Impact**:
   - Victor Scott II addresses a critical need in stolen bases, a category where your roster was relatively weak.
   - His elite speed (99th percentile sprint speed) gives you a significant edge in SB, a standalone category in your league.

2. **Catcher Depth**:
   - Carrying two catchers (Wells and Contreras) in a one-catcher league was suboptimal.
   - While Wells has upside, his time-share situation with the Yankees limits his immediate fantasy value.
   - Contreras is durable enough to anchor the position, making Wells expendable.

3. **Category Balance**:
   - Scott II's elite speed adds a unique skill set that complements your roster, while Wells' value as a second catcher was redundant.

### **Risk Assessment**

- If Contreras suffers an injury, you'll need to stream or replace a catcher midseason.
- Scott's batting average risk (.220–.240 projected) could hurt your AVG category slightly, but his SB upside outweighs this downside.

## **Move 2: Dropping Drew Rasmussen for AJ Smith-Shawver**

### **Rationale**

1. **Pitching Depth and Upside**:
   - Rasmussen’s injury history (internal brace surgery) and limited innings projection made him unreliable.
   - Smith-Shawver offers immediate value as part of the Braves' rotation, with strong spring performance (20 K/5 BB in 16 IP) and high strikeout potential.

2. **Short-Term Production**:
   - Smith-Shawver’s rotation spot might be temporary (until Spencer Strider returns), but he can help you dominate Ks and ratios in the short term.
   - Rasmussen’s return from injury is uncertain, and even if healthy, his role could be limited by Tampa Bay’s pitching philosophy.
