# Strategic Decision: Multi-Player Waiver Move - Adding Victor Scott II & AJ Smith-Shawver

Based on league settings, positional needs, and category analysis, I've executed a strategic multi-player waiver move, dropping **Austin Wells** for **Victor Scott II** and **Drew Rasmussen** for **AJ Smith-Shawver** to address team weaknesses while maintaining overall roster balance.

## **League Context and Strategic Implications**
### *Category Mix and Position Analysis*
Our league uses **8 hitting categories** (R, H, HR, RBI, SB, AVG, OPS, XBH) vs. **6 pitching categories** (W, SV, K, ERA, WHIP, QS). This slight skew toward hitting rewards teams that prioritize offensive firepower, particularly in standalone categories like **SB** and **XBH**.

The current roster is balanced but lacks elite speed, with SB being our weakest offensive category. Additionally, carrying two catchers (Wells and Contreras) in a one-catcher league was suboptimal. While pitching has been solid, we have sufficient depth to absorb the loss of a speculative arm like Rasmussen in favor of a higher-upside option.

### *Current Standings Impact*
Currently sitting in 4th place overall, we're:
- 7th in SB (12 behind 6th place)
- 3rd in ERA (0.22 ahead of 4th place)
- 4th in WHIP (0.03 ahead of 5th place)

Adding Scott directly addresses our SB deficit while Smith-Shawver provides immediate strikeout upside and ratio help in our pitching categories.

## **Player Comparison Analysis**
### *Victor Scott II (OF, STL)*
- **Key Stats**: .366 AVG, 1.225 OPS, 5 SB in 35 spring training PA; 99th percentile sprint speed (30 ft/sec)
- **Projections**: 30-40 SB floor with everyday CF role; .260/.320/.380 slash line
- **Role/Playing Time**: Recently named Cardinals' starting CF; expected to bat 9th with regular playing time

### *Austin Wells (C, NYY)*
- **Key Stats**: Limited playing time in time-share situation with Yankees
- **Projections**: Part-time role limits counting stat upside despite solid rate stats
- **Role/Playing Time**: Splitting time at catcher position, reducing overall fantasy value

### *AJ Smith-Shawver (SP, ATL)*
- **Key Stats**: Strong spring performance (20 K/5 BB in 16 IP); high strikeout potential
- **Projections**: Immediate rotation spot with Braves; strong K upside and ratio help
- **Role/Playing Time**: Secured rotation spot, though may be temporary until Spencer Strider returns

### *Drew Rasmussen (SP, TB)*
- **Key Stats**: Returning from internal brace surgery; limited to 48.2 IP in 2023 with 4.01 ERA, 1.34 WHIP
- **Projections**: 50-60 IP ceiling for 2025; likely 4.00 ERA, 1.30 WHIP with limited QS potential
- **Role/Playing Time**: Expected to be on strict pitch/innings limits; potential for bullpen role or opener duties

## **Roster Impact Analysis**
### *Position Depth Chart (Post-Move)*
| Position | Starter | Backup | Notes |
|----------|---------|--------|-------|
| C | Willson Contreras | | Durable starter, no backup needed |
| SP | Paul Skenes | | Elite prospect, 33% K rate, ace upside |
| SP | Taj Bradley | | Post-hype breakout candidate, 28% K rate |
| SP | Grayson Rodriguez | | Currently DTD, high upside when healthy |
| SP | AJ Smith-Shawver | | Strong K upside, favorable team context |
| RP | Raisel Iglesias | | Secure closer role, 90th percentile K% |
| RP | Aroldis Chapman | | Potential saves, elite Ks (37.1% K%) |
| OF | Seiya Suzuki | | 30 HR upside |
| OF | Pete Crow-Armstrong | | 15 HR/33 SB potential |
| OF | James Wood | | Power/speed hybrid |
| OF | Fernando Tatis Jr. | | OF eligibility, 30/30 threat |
| OF | Victor Scott II | | Elite speed specialist |

### *Category Impact*
Adding Scott significantly boosts our SB potential, potentially moving us from 7th to 4th in the category over the next few weeks. Smith-Shawver provides immediate strikeout upside and ratio help, potentially improving our standing in K, ERA, and WHIP. Dropping Wells consolidates our roster by eliminating a redundant catcher position. The net effect should be positive for our overall category balance.

## **Risk Mitigation Strategies**
### *Contingency Plans*
If Scott struggles or loses playing time:
1. Use the streaming spot to target another speed specialist
2. Focus on winning other categories to compensate
3. Explore trade options for SB help using pitching surplus

If Smith-Shawver loses his rotation spot:
1. Use his roster spot for streaming high-upside arms
2. Monitor Strider's return timeline and adjust accordingly
3. Target another high-K pitcher on waivers

If Contreras gets injured (no backup catcher):
1. Use a waiver claim on a top available catcher
2. Stream catchers based on matchups
3. Consider trading from pitching depth for catcher help

### *Waiver Wire Alternatives*
Current streaming options if needed:
- **Hayden Birdsong** (SF): 28% K rate, favorable matchup vs. COL (29th vs. RHP)
- **Kyle Harrison** (SF): 26% K rate, favorable matchup vs. MIA (24th in wRC+)
- **Gavin Stone** (LAD): Sinkerballer, favorable matchup vs. WAS (27th vs. RHP)

## **Conclusion**
This multi-player waiver move addresses several roster construction issues while improving category balance:

1. **SB category**: Scott's elite speed directly improves our weakest offensive category
2. **Pitching upside**: Smith-Shawver offers immediate K upside and ratio help compared to Rasmussen's uncertain timeline
3. **Roster efficiency**: Eliminating a redundant catcher position streamlines our roster construction
4. **League dynamics**: The hitting-heavy category emphasis justifies prioritizing Scott's unique skill set
